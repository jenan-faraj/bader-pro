🌟 Bader | Community-Driven Problem Solving Platform
Bader is a web platform that empowers local communities to report public issues in their neighborhoods (e.g., broken roads, garbage piles, damaged infrastructure), and helps transform these reports into actionable projects that the public can volunteer for, donate to, or support through local businesses.

🧩 Project Idea
Many neighborhoods suffer from common issues such as:

Damaged or unsafe roads

Overflowing trash or random dumping

Broken street lights

Unmaintained parks or sidewalks

Bader allows citizens to submit reports, and the system transforms those into community-led projects. People and organizations can join the solution through:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Volunteering

💰 Donations

🏢 Company sponsorships

Together, we take action to make our cities better.
